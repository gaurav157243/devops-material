* Create an EC2 instance, enable port 8080 in security group and provide the following commands in the EC2 userdata:

#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
sudo yum install jenkins -y
sudo yum install git maven -y
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins

* setup jenkins using the http://<ec2-ip>:8080

* To get the password, connect to the master node and 
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

* install the recommended plugin

# To connect to the slave node,generate a ssh key; dont use sudo with this command
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/jenkins_slave_key
<press enter enter 4 times>


# get the private ssh key for master slave setup
cat ~/.ssh/jenkins_slave_key

# Add SSH Credentials in Jenkins
Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
Select System  and then the appropriate domain (e.g., (global)).
Click on Add Credentials.
Choose SSH Username with private key.
Enter ec2-user (or the appropriate username) as the username.
Select Enter directly and paste the content of the private key (~/.ssh/jenkins_slave_key).
Optionally, provide an ID and description.


### Setup Slave node

* create ec2 instance, open port 22 and install the following comand via the EC2 user data:

#!/bin/bash
sudo yum upgrade
sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
sudo yum install git maven wget -y
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh


# copy the public key from the master node and paste the same into the slave node
cat ~/.ssh/jenkins_slave_key.pub

vi authorized_keys 
<paste the copied public key into this file and save the file>


### on Master node
# go to the master node and see if you can ssh to the slave node now without the password
ssh -i ~/.ssh/jenkins_slave_key ec2-user@<slave-ip-address>

# if successfully connected, then enter "exit" command to exit from the shell.
exit

###Create and Configure Slave Node in Jenkins
Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Nodes > New Node.
Enter a name for the node (e.g., slave1).
Select Permanent Agent and click OK.
Configure the node with the following settings:
Remote root directory: /home/ec2-user/jenkins (or a directory where Jenkins should store files on the slave)
Labels: Any labels you want to assign to the node (e.g., linux)
Launch method: Launch agents via SSH
Host: <slave-ip> (the IP address of the slave node)
Credentials: Select the SSH credentials you added earlier
Host Key Verification Strategy: Select Manually trusted key Verification Strategy and check the option Trust the initial connection.

Check  "Disk Space Monitoring Thresholds"
In all the thresholds boxes, enter 100MiB
